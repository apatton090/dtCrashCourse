    "Suppose $X$ is the random variable for the experiment, and it has a particular (numeric) value, $x$. Suppose $Z$ is the set of all possible $x$. If $Z$ is finite or countably infinite, then $X$ is said to be discrete if all of it. Basically, this means that if all of the elements of $Z$ can be mapped to a subset of the integer set, then $X$ is a discrete random variable. If $X$ is not discrete, then $X$ is said to be a continuous random variable.\n",
