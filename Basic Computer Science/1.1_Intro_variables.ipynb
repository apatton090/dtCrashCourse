    "The purpose of this crash course is the to teach the core ideas of computer science without using a specific programming language. The basic computer science concepts applies to all programming languages. This crash course will be taught using pseudo-code. I believe there is no need to worry about language specific syntax when learning the basics. Since this crash course does not focus on a particular language, a programming language may have a \"basic\" feature/ concept that is not covered in this crash course. This is ideally supplimented by example code.\n"

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a \"thing\" that can store data and has a name.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A variable in computer science is similar to variable in math.  \n",
    "For example, the statement $4x + 5$ and suppose $x=4$. \n",
    "- The variable name is x\n",
    "- It has a value of 4\n",
    "- This entire statement evaluates to 21  \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between a variable in math and a variable in computer science is that in math, you can use a variable to represent the solution to an equation.  \n",
    "For example, the statement $4x + 5 = 25$.\n",
    "- In math, this means find a value of $x$ that satisfy the equation. Therefore, in the this equation $x=5$.\n",
    "- In computer science, it will evaluate the left hand side. Then it will compare to see if that statement is true or false.\n",
    "    - Suppose $x=4$\n",
    "    - The left hand side evaluates to be 21.\n",
    "    - Then it checks if $21 = 25$. Which is a false statement.\n",
    "    - So the entire expression evaluates to be false.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a variable, we first need to declare it and assign it a value. Variable declaration simply states that a variable with _____ name exists. After a variable has been declared, we can assign it a value. The first time a variable has been assigned a value is called initialization. How this is done is dependent on the programming language. Sometimes they can be done in a single line of code, while others require that they are done in multiple lines of code. Some languages gives you the option of doing both in a single or multiple lines of code."

    "### Basic Data Types\n",
    "A variable can store many different types of data. Generally speaking, they can be broken into 5 categories: \n",
    "- boolean values (true/ false)\n",
    "- integer numbers (integers)\n",
    "- floating point numbers (real numbers)\n",
    "- strings (words)\n",
    "    - Normally denoted by being surrounded by \"\"\n",
    "- objects (everything else)\n",
    "    - This is not a basic data type and will be elaborated more in the object section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are either statically typed or dynamically typed. Statically typed language requires the data type be specified when the variable is being declared. It also does not allow you to assign a value whose data type is not the same as its declared type.  \n",
    "For example, suppose we declare that x is an integer.  \n",
    "- x = 4\n",
    "    - This assignment is valid because 4 is an integer\n",
    "- x = 4.4\n",
    "    - This assignment is invalid because 4.4 is a floating point number\n",
    "- x = 4.0\n",
    "    - This assignment is also invalid because there is a decimal in the number, the programming language will treat is as floating point number.\n",
    "Dynamically typed languages does not require you to specify the data type when declaring a variable, and you can assign it what every you want. So all of the previous examples are valid in a dynamically typed language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More details about the data types\n",
    "Booleans is a data type that represent true/ false values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Integers numbers corresponds to integers in math. However, unlike math, they cannot arbitrary large in magnitude. This is because a computer only gives the programming language so much space to store a single value, so it is bounded by a min and max value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers corresponds to real numbers in math (numbers with decimals). They have precision problems, meaning they cannot represent some numbers 100% accurately. Imagine trying to write the number $\\frac{1}{3}$ in scientific notation. The result should be something like $3.33333333 * 10^{-1}$. Notice this is technically not $\\frac{1}{3}$ because the decimal needs to repeat forever. However, no matter how many decimal places we use, it will never equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ exactly. Floating points essentially store numbers in base 2 using scientific notation. Using similar reasoning, there are some numbers it can approximate very closely, but never match exactly. Also, like the integer data type, floating points is bounded by a min and max value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a string of characters.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are \"things\" that holds other various other data and has some predefined actions. It will be elaborated more in the object section."

    "\n",
    "An array is first example of an object. It is a collection of variables of a single data type. The amount of variables the array can hold is fixed and is predefined when the array is created. This idea is similar to a vectors in mathematics. Like vectors, the elements of the array is identified by its position or index. However, unlike math vectors, the first position is typically labeled as 0.  \n",
    "- For this crash course, brackets will be used to access the elements of the array.\n",
